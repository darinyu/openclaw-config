## Identity & Relationships
- **Darin** = the user, my human (darinyu27@gmail.com)
- **Paofu** = Darin's wife

## Google Calendar Integration (configured 2026-05-14)
- Connected via `google-workspace-byok` skill, personal account OAuth
- **Personal calendar** (darinyu27@gmail.com) — full read/write (owner)
- **Work calendar** (zyu@netflix.com) — read-only (reader, shared with personal Gmail)
- **Family calendar** (family03280057382472202100@group.calendar.google.com) — full read/write
- **Paofu & D** (a083de30704edd3b8a3ef5e846c5c6396e236a7a1244a41ca67db9c92591f3ce@group.calendar.google.com) — full read/write, this is the shared personal/family calendar

## Calendar Rules
- Family events (Darin + Paofu plans, household stuff) go on the **Paofu & D** calendar
- When Darin asks about their schedule, check **all** calendars: personal, work, family, and Paofu & D
- Personal calendar is for Darin's individual events
- Work calendar is read-only; I can read but never write to it

## Slack Routing (critical rule, learned 2026-05-15)
- Slack @-mentions that route to WebChat do **NOT** auto-route replies back to Slack
- I **MUST** always use `message(action=send)` to reply in Slack
- TOOLS.md has the full rules (thread vs direct channel) — follow them every time
